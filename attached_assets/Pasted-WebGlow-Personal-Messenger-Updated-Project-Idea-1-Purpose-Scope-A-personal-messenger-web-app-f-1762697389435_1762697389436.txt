WebGlow Personal Messenger – Updated Project Idea
1. Purpose & Scope

A personal messenger web app for WebGlow where clients can only chat with the admin.

UI/UX like WhatsApp:

Chat bubbles

Emojis & GIFs

Media attachments (images, videos, files)

Typing indicators, read receipts

Mobile-friendly with PWA support (“Add to Home Screen”) and push notifications for new messages.

Only admin can access all client messages through an admin panel.

2. User Accounts

Sign-up/login using Firebase Authentication (email & password).

Optional phone number collection for admin records.

Each client gets a unique User ID.

3. Messaging Features

Text messages with animated chat bubbles.

Media sharing:

Images, videos, files stored in GitHub repo using Personal Access Token (PAT).

Emoji & GIF support.

Typing indicator and read receipts.

Push notifications for new messages via Firebase Cloud Messaging or Web Push API.

4. Admin Panel

View all client messages.

View client details: name, email, phone number, User ID.

Search/filter clients and messages.

Reply directly to clients.

Dark navy modern theme matching client UI.

Smooth animations for messages.

5. Database & Storage

Firebase Realtime Database / Firestore:

Store all messages, metadata, timestamps, and client info.

GitHub (Private Repo):

Store media files (images, videos, documents).

Use GitHub PAT to push media from the frontend/backend to the repo securely.

This setup removes the need for any other traditional database for media storage.
